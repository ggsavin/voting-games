                   been successfully applied to many different continuous
                   control tasks. While RL algorithms are often conceptually
                   simple, their state-of-the-art implementations take numerous
                   low- and high-level design decisions that strongly affect
                   the performance of the resulting agents. Those choices are
                   usually not extensively discussed in the literature, leading
                   to discrepancy between published descriptions of algorithms
                   and their implementations. This makes it hard to attribute
                   progress in RL and slows down overall progress
                   [Engstrom'20]. As a step towards filling that gap, we
                   implement >50 such ``choices'' in a unified on-policy RL
                   framework, allowing us to investigate their impact in a
                   large-scale empirical study. We train over 250'000 agents in
                   five continuous control environments of different complexity
                   and provide insights and practical recommendations for

  abstract = "Social deduction games present a unique challenge for AI agents,
              because communication plays a central role in most of them, and
              deception plays a key role in game play. To be successful in such
              games, players need to come up with convincing stories, but also
              discern the truth of statements of other players and adapt to the
              information learned from them. In this paper we present an
              approach for virtual agents that have to determine how long to
              stick to their story in the light of information obtained from
              other players. We apply this approach to a particular social
              deduction game, One Night Ultimate Werewolf, and demonstrate the
              effect of different levels of commitment to an agent's story.",
