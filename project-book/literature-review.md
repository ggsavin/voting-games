## Game theoretic work done in mafia

## RL

AIWolf {cite}`toriumi2017ai` is a popular Werewolf game framework and yearly competition run out of Japan *cite the competition and the framework*, which pits agents against eachother in full NLP or protocol limited communication modes. Agents have been trained *cite*


RLupus {cite}`Brandizzi2021RLupusCT` explored explicit communication in Werewolf, by adding a signal channel to the action. A follow up {cite}`Lipinski2022EMP` showed that a single word vocabulary is a good enough heuristic. They also explored longer communication rounds, much like we allow multiple accusation rounds.


Our work takes the voting mechanism and replaces it with an approval variant, to see if there is any difference.
