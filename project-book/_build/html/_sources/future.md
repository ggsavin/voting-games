# Future Directions

Different reward functions such as difference rewards, maybe even a VCG mechanism could be interesting (contrasting with a counterfactual directly)? What is the goal with these though? To lower werewolf win rates? Or to see the impacts they have?

- Improve and experiment with observation/state space. Whaat is needed here, can we bring this down to an embedded space?
- Extend the game with more roles
- Many more voting mechanisms available. Which one is best for a hidden role game? What does best mean?
- Different mixes of policies playing (i.e behavioral villagers, raandom  villagers, trained villagers)
- Learning Wolves and how they perform against villager combinations and other learning agents
- Another indicator, measuring commitment (i.e how likely a villager is to stay with a vote throughout accusation phases. Slightly related to the commitment paper *cite*)
