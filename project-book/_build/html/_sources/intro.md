# COMP 5903 - Voting impact on hidden role games

## Introduction

Werewolf/mafia are interchangeable names for the same underlying game, so any 

It has been used to study non-verbal communication between humans
(Nonverbal communications. Developing role-playing games 'Mafia' and 'Murderer') and also link to the paper about this same stuff

F or cooperative domains, the key issue is that learners obtain a local/personal reward but need to learn a decision that is good for the society of agents. 


## Motivation

Approval voting has more implicit and explicit information, and allows for more expression when voting. Naturally, we ask ourselves what kind of impact changing the voting mechanism underlying werewolf would have on the ability of the simulated agents to learn and their chances of winning.

## Our work

We use Independent Learners with a shared policy for all the agents vs a JAL because we  dont want action space to scale

## Future

Different reward functions such as difference rewards, maybe even a VCG mechanism could be interesting (contrasting with a counterfactual directly)? What is the goal with these though? To lower werewolf win rates? Or to see the impacts they have?

## Analysis

In 2006, the computer scientists Braverman, Etesami and Mossel proved that without detectives and with perfect players the randomized strategy is optimal for both citizens and mafia - Wikipedia
