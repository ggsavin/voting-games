# Werewolf - The Game

## Quick History
Werewolf is a 1997 re-imagining by Andrew Plotkin [^werewolf-boardgame] of a game known as mafia[^mafia-wikipedia], credited to Dimitry Davidoff in the Psychology Department of Moscow State University in 1986.

The game models a conflict between an informed minority (mafiosi) and an unaware majority(villagers).

Originally created for psychological research, it has spread all over the world and is now in the top 50 most historically and culturally significant games published[^top50]

## Description

Werewolf is a multi player game between two competing teams comprised of villagers and werewolves. The werewolf team is a hidden subset of the villager team as true villagers cannot tell who the werewolves are, and must try and deduce their identities.


Gameplay alternates between day and night phases. During the day, villagers vote on who amongst them should be executed for the crime of being a werewolf, and at night, wolves vote on which helpless villager to kill. Communication between agents either takes place during the voting round, or precedes it in multiple communication rounds.

Once a player dies, they reveal their role to the rest of the players.

Different versions of the game slightly alter rules, or introduce various new roles with their own special abilities. In our case, we have simplified the game as much as possible to focus on the voting mechanisms used by agents to determine who to execute and kill.

The game ends when either all the werewolves have been executed, or there are more werewolves than villagers remaining.
